## Research interests

Nowadays I am mostly interested in using GDR4 to build a catalogue of Solar-System-like architectures (SSLAs). That is a Jupiter analogue plus an Earth. With a catalogue in hand several interesting things can be done (population analysis): Jupyter analogue occurrence p(M, a, e), SSLA occurence and dependences (host star age, mass, metallicity, etc.), mutual inclination characterisation. This new information on system architecture and dynamics will open new pathways to assess planet formation and migration models.

Furthermore, with precise orbit characterisation we can do atmospheric characterisation for these Earth twins and, while rare, plan accordingly for opportunities to capture transiting Jupiter analogues.
