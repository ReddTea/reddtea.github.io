# About Me

I'm an exoplanet researcher focused on detecting and characterising long-period giant planets by combining precision radial-velocities with astrometry. I develop Bayesian methods and open-source tools to make model selection and evidence estimation more reliable in challenging multi-modal posteriors.

## Highlights

I built [`reddemcee`](https://reddemcee.readthedocs.io/en/latest), an adaptive parallel-tempering MCMC sampler in Python with original implementations of temperature ladders, and next-gen Bayesian evidence estimation (including a novel hybrid method which combines the best of thermodynamical integration and the stepping-stones algorithm); and [`EMPEROR`](https://astroemperor.readthedocs.io/en/latest), a Python library for joint RV+astrometry orbit fitting (multi-instrument offsets and jitters, GP noise models, stellar activity indices, etc). On the observational side, I've led and analysed programs on CORALIE and worked with HARPS data, extending the CHEPS sample to uncover Jupiter analogues (using combined RV and Hipparcos/Gaia data). 

## Methods
Computationally, I specialise in APT MCMC, evidence-driven model comparison, and stellar activity noise modelling. 

Data-wise, my expertise lays in high-precision radial velocities and astrometry data.

## Now seeking
Currently looking for postdoctoral positions where I can combine algorithm development with bulk data analysis (in preparation Gaia DR4/Roman/PLATO), to tackle down on important exoplanet population questions, like how common true Jupiter analogues are, to answer exoplanet formation questions, like how outer giants help shaping the inner architecture of stellar systems.
