# About Me

I'm an exoplanet researcher focused on detecting and characterising long-period giant planets by combining precision radial-velocities with astrometry. I develop Bayesian methods and open-source tools to make model selection and evidence estimation more reliable in challenging multi-modal posteriors.

## Now seeking
Postdoctoral positions where I can combine algorithm development with bulk data analysis (in preparation Gaia DR4/Roman/PLATO/ELTs), to tackle on important exoplanet population and formation questions, like how common true Jupiter analogues are, how outer giants help shaping the inner architecture of planetary systems, and how crucial Jupiter is for life on Earth.


## Highlights

I built [`reddemcee`](https://reddemcee.readthedocs.io/en/latest), an adaptive parallel-tempering MCMC sampler in Python with original implementations of temperature ladders, and next-gen Bayesian evidence estimation (including a novel hybrid method which combines the best of thermodynamical integration and the stepping-stones algorithm); and [`EMPEROR`](https://astroemperor.readthedocs.io/en/latest), a Python library for joint RV+astrometry orbit fitting (multi-instrument offsets and jitters, GP noise models, stellar activity indices, etc). On the observational side, I've led and analysed programs on CORALIE, with several nights of  and worked with HARPS data, extending the CHEPS sample to uncover Jupiter analogues (using combined RV and Hipparcos/Gaia data). 





## Technical strenghts

    * __Bayesian inference and statistical methodology__: I have strong expertise in Bayesian inference, including MCMC and nested sampling algorithms, Gaussian processes, model comparison, and hierarchical modelling.

    * __Joint RV+astrometry frameworks__: I specialise in joint RV+astrometry (Hipparcos/Gaia+RVs) and stellar activity (e.g., differential rotation, granulation, magnetic cycles, Rossiter–McLaughlin) modelling.
    
    * __Software development__: I develop open-source tools (packaging, documentation) with modular designs, version control, and reproducible workflows.

    * __Computing, HPC, and infrastructure__: I have hands-on experience with computing infrastructure, from building a small server to running large-scale MCMC campaigns.
 
    * __Surveys and instruments__: My experience spans handling survey-class data (e.g., CHEPS, HARPS, Hipparcos, Gaia), and extensive on-site observations with CORALIE, giving me practical understanding of instrument systematics.
